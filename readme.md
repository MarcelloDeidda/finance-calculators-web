## 1.Project name:

Finance Calculators Web


## 2.Description:

This webpage implements various formulas to calculate:

- Mortgage Repayments

- Simple interest

- Compound interest

The project consists of an html file, containing the structure of the page, a css file, containing custom styles, and a js file, where the calculations are performed and then rendered through DOM manipulation. The page is built with Bootstrap v5.2.

The formulas I used are the following:

- Mortgage:  x = (i * P)/(1 - (1 + i) ^ (-n))

- Simple Interest: A = P(1 + r * t)

- Compound Interest:  A = P(1 + r) ^ t
